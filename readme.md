WIP. Implementation of the board-building game Machi Koro, for two-players. The plan is to to study the game by ML agent self-play. I'm not planning on making a pleasant human UI for actually playing the game.

Remixes of existing cards should be very simple to create, if one wanted to explore rebalancing the game.

Currently dependent on `graphviz` for visualization.
